# Project 1: Movie Recommender

## ✏️ Description 
With this project, we wanted to create a user friendly website that would allow a user to view top rated movies, and filter genre types. The user can make a search, as well as use the given genre filters to help make an advised selection. Once a user finds a movie, they can then use the map modal in the bottom right corner, to search for nearby theaters!
